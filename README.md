### Application of Mixture Density Networks for Modeling Gas-Surface Interactions in Rarefied Flows

The development of micro-, nano- and vacuum technologies demands the simulation low-temperature (300 - 1000 K) rarefied gas flows. This research investigates the application of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) for modeling gas-surface interactions in rarefied gas flows, especially for Ar-Au and \(H_2-Ni\) systems in iso-thermal/non iso-thermal, flow/no flow conditions. The goal is to predict post-collision velocities and accommodation coefficients (ACs) for gas molecules interacting with a solid surface using MDN, compare it with the ACs obtained from Molecular Dynamics simulation data, to evaluate the effectiveness of MDN in modelling rarefied gas flows. The MDN was implement using Python. Bayesian search is used as optimization algorithm to obtain hyper-parameters for MDN including optimal number of Gaussian distributions. The results for different scenarios are listed. From the results, it is evident that the MDN has the potential to be a powerful tool for gas-surface interaction modeling.
